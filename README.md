# Terrorism-Threat-Perception-and-Response-in-India
I have built a machine learning model to help the security forces to analyze the threats and stop them before they happen in India. At first, I have drawn a detailed analysis of all the terror attacks which have occurred since 1970 and provided a machine learning-based simulation to simulate the number of perpetrators, the weapon which could be used, possible targets, and key-locations to execute a successful attack. And then I have built a predictive model to predict the name of the organization after the attack also to predict the name of the organization before the attack based on some intelligence. These are the vital clue to begin our investigations once the attack has occurred so that the motive behind the attack can be known and any further attempt can be neutralized and information about the organization before the attack will help us to build counter-strategies based on their pattern of selection of target and pattern of attack.
